## Project Overview

Threshold signing library in Go. Implements two protocols:

- **DKLS23** — Threshold ECDSA over secp256k1 ([DKLS23 paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765), IEEE S&P 2024)
- **FROST** — Threshold Schnorr / Ed25519 ([RFC 9591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html), FROST(Ed25519, SHA-512))

- **Module**: `github.com/chrisalmeida/go-mpc`
- **Go**: 1.26+

## Build & Test

```bash
make test          # run all tests
make test-race     # run with race detector (what CI runs)
make test-secret   # run with runtime/secret memory erasure (linux only)
make bench         # run benchmarks
make cover         # show coverage summary
make lint          # go vet + staticcheck
make ci            # full CI pipeline locally
```

Or directly:
```bash
go test ./...
go test -race -timeout 120s ./...
GOEXPERIMENT=runtimesecret go test -race -timeout 120s ./...  # with memory erasure
```

## Code Layout

- `dkls23/` — Core protocol package. All cryptographic code lives here.
  - `dkg.go` — Feldman VSS distributed key generation (Protocol 7.1)
  - `sign.go` — 3-round threshold signing (Protocol 3.6)
  - `refresh.go` — Proactive key share refresh (KMOS21)
  - `vole.go` — Vector OLE (Protocol 5.2)
  - `ot.go` / `ot_extension.go` — Base OT and IKNP extension
  - `commitment.go` — FCom and FZero primitives
  - `persistence.go` — AES-256-GCM encrypted serialization
  - `encoding.go` — Wire format JSON marshaling
  - `errors.go` — Typed error categories
  - `params.go` — Security constants and package-level docs
- `frost/` — FROST threshold Schnorr / Ed25519 package (RFC 9591).
  - `keygen.go` — Feldman VSS distributed key generation (2 rounds)
  - `sign.go` — 2-round threshold signing + aggregation
  - `refresh.go` — Proactive key share refresh
  - `verify.go` — Cofactored Ed25519 verification
  - `hash.go` — H1-H5 domain-separated hash functions
  - `persistence.go` — Encrypted serialization
  - `encoding.go` — Wire format JSON marshaling
  - `errors.go` — Typed error categories
  - `params.go` — Ciphersuite constants and package-level docs
- `example/` — Runnable demos
  - `shared/` — AES-256-GCM encryptor shared by both demos
  - `dkls23/` — 3-of-3 DKLS23 ECDSA demo (`cd example/dkls23 && go run .`)
  - `frost/` — 2-of-3 FROST Ed25519 demo (`cd example/frost && go run .`)
  - Separate `go.mod` with `replace github.com/chrisalmeida/go-mpc => ../`
  - Not included in `go test ./...` — run and test independently
- `internal/secretdo/` — Build-tag shim for `runtime/secret` (Go 1.26 experimental).
  - `do_experiment.go` — Calls `runtime/secret.Do` when built with `GOEXPERIMENT=runtimesecret`
  - `do_fallback.go` — Direct call passthrough on all other builds
  - Both `dkls23/` and `frost/` import this package to wrap all exported functions that handle secret material

## Conventions

- Error messages: `"dkls23 FunctionName: description"` or `"frost FunctionName: description"`
- Formatting: `gofmt`, `go vet`, `staticcheck` must all pass
- Tests: maintain 90%+ coverage, always run with `-race`
- Dependencies: keep minimal — only add if cryptographically necessary
- Exported types have GoDoc comments referencing paper sections where applicable

## Test Performance

CI runs on resource-constrained GitHub Actions runners where crypto-heavy tests can be 3–5× slower than local.

### dkls23 test patterns

1. **Parallel VOLE setup** — `buildSetups()` in `helpers_test.go` runs pairwise VOLE/FZero setup concurrently across goroutines (one per party pair).
2. **Cached 3-of-3 fixture** — `fullSetup(t)` builds the expensive DKG+VOLE setup once via `sync.Once` and deep-copies via JSON for each caller. Use `fullSetup(t)` for any test that needs a standard 3-of-3. Only call `setupSigners(t, ids, threshold)` for non-standard configs (2-of-3, 2-of-2, etc.).
3. **`t.Parallel()`** — All tests that do crypto work (VOLE, OT, signing, refresh) must include `t.Parallel()` so they overlap. This is safe because `fullSetup` returns independent deep copies and `setupSigners`/`buildSetups` create fresh state.

When adding new dkls23 tests:
- If the test needs a 3-of-3 setup, use `fullSetup(t)` (cached) — **not** `setupSigners(t, []int{1,2,3}, 3)`.
- Add `t.Parallel()` to any test that takes >100ms or calls `fullSetup`/`setupSigners`/`runVOLEPairwise`.
- Never share mutable state between parallel tests; each test should own its setup.

### frost test patterns

1. **Cached 3-of-3 fixture** — `fullSetup(t)` in `helpers_test.go` runs DKG once via `sync.Once` and deep-copies via JSON for each caller. FROST has no VOLE/OT setup, so the DKG is fast, but the cache follows the same pattern for consistency.
2. **`fullSign(t, keyShares, signers, msg)`** — Runs a complete signing session (round 1 → round 2 → aggregate with share verification). Use this for any test that needs a valid signature.
3. **`buildDKG(allIDs, threshold)`** — Runs a fresh DKG for non-standard configs (2-of-3, 2-of-2). Use instead of `fullSetup` when testing non-3-of-3 setups.
4. **`t.Parallel()`** — Same rules as dkls23: add to any test doing crypto work.

When adding new frost tests:
- If the test needs a 3-of-3 setup, use `fullSetup(t)` (cached) — **not** `buildDKG([]int{1,2,3}, 3)`.
- Add `t.Parallel()` to any test that takes >100ms or calls `fullSetup`/`buildDKG`/`fullSign`.
- Never share mutable state between parallel tests; each test should own its setup.

## Security-Sensitive Areas

All code in `dkls23/` and `frost/` is security-critical.

### dkls23
- DKG (Feldman VSS commitment verification)
- Signing (nonce generation, consistency checks)
- VOLE/OT (oblivious transfer correctness)
- Key refresh (share re-randomization)
- Persistence (encryption key handling)

### frost
- DKG (Feldman VSS commitment verification, commitment count validation)
- Signing (hedged nonce generation via `nonce_generate`, nonce reuse prevention)
- Aggregation (signature share verification for identifiable abort)
- Key refresh (zero-constant polynomial share re-randomization)
- Verification (cofactored equation, non-canonical point/scalar rejection)
- Persistence (encryption key handling)

Ephemeral secrets (polynomial coefficients, nonce shares, Lagrange coefficients) are zeroized after use in both packages.

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on push to `main` and all PRs: `go vet` → `staticcheck` → `go test -race` → coverage summary. Reproduce locally with `make ci`.
